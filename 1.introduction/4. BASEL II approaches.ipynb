    "\t- Credit Risk\n",
    "\t\t* Standardised approach or SA foundation: the capital is a % of the total exposure. Banks are required to use data from external credit agencies to assess credit risk, like FICO, Moody's etc do credit risk rating.\n",

    "\t\tHome Loans, mortgages - banks should keep capital = 35% of exposure\n",

    "When banks give out the loans they collect data and this data could be used for more detailed estimation of credit risk under IRB approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Banks would like to transit from SA to F-IRB, then to A-IRB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because SA requires bank to hold as much as 75% of the loan.\n",
    "While under F-IRB and A-IRB, banks are allowed to do their own credit ratings.\n",
    "If a bank gets a proper risk profile of an individual, they would need to hold less amount of money.\n",
